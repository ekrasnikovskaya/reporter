# reporter
Hello! I'm just a silly little module, which will help people and QA's to make more colorful html report after running all the tests. 

What I do?
- generate an HTML file, which contains of success or error messages. You can see an example if you copy the report folder to your computer and open 'report.html' in your browser

How to use me?
- see an example of usage in 'usingExample.js' with command 'node usingExample.js'.
